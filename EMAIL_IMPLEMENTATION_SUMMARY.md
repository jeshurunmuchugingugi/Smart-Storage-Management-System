- EmailService class
- `send_booking_confirmation()` method
- `send_payment_receipt()` method
- Graceful degradation (works without API key)
- Error handling and logging

### 2. `server/test_email.py` (120 lines)
- Test script for email functionality

- Configuration checker
- Usage: `python test_email.py your@email.com`

### 3. Documentation
- `EMAIL_INTEGRATION.md` - Full documentation
- `SENDGRID_QUICKSTART.md` - 5-minute setup guide
- Updated `README.md` with email section

---

##  Files Modified

### 1. `server/app.py` (3 changes)
```python
# Import
from email_service import EmailService

# Initialize
email_service = EmailService()

# In BookingListResource.post() - after booking created
email_service.send_booking_confirmation(email_data)

# In MpesaCallbackResource.post() - after payment confirmed
email_service.send_payment_receipt(email_data)
```

### 2. `server/requirements.txt`
```
sendgrid==6.11.0  # Added
```

### 3. `server/.env`
```bash
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key_here
SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com
```

---

## Features Implemented

### Booking Confirmation Email
- **Trigger**: When customer creates booking
- **Recipient**: Customer email from booking form
- **Content**: Booking ID, unit details, dates, cost
- **Integration**: `POST /api/bookings` endpoint

###  Payment Receipt Email
- **Trigger**: When M-Pesa payment succeeds
- **Recipient**: Customer email from booking
- **Content**: Receipt number, amount, payment method
- **Integration**: M-Pesa callback handler

### Graceful Degradation
- System works without SendGrid configured
- Logs email attempts for debugging
- No errors if API key missing
- Bookings/payments still succeed

###  Error Handling
- Try-catch blocks around email sending
- Detailed error logging
- Non-blocking (app continues if email fails)
