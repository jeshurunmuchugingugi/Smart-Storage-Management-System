# Issue Summary and Solutions

## Overview

You reported three main issues with your Smart Storage Management System:
1. Storage page not displaying data after creating in admin
2. Cannot book a storage unit
3. Cannot access the payments page

**Root Cause**: All three issues stem from the same problem - **the Flask backend server is not running**.

---

## Detailed Analysis

### Issue 1: Storage Page Not Displaying Data

**What's Happening:**
- You create storage units in the admin dashboard
- The units appear in the admin dashboard
- But when you navigate to `/storage`, no units are displayed (or only static fallback data shows)

**Why:**
The `StorageUnits.js` component tries to fetch data from the backend API:
```javascript
const response = await fetch('http://localhost:5001/api/units');
```

When the backend server is not running on port 5001, this request fails. The component then falls back to displaying static hardcoded data instead of your actual database units.

**Evidence:**
- Database check shows units exist: `sqlite3 instance/storage.db "SELECT * FROM storageunit;"`
- Server connectivity test fails: Connection refused on port 5001
- Browser console likely shows: "Backend not available, using static data"

---

### Issue 2: Cannot Book a Storage Unit

**What's Happening:**
- You click "BOOK AND PAY NOW" on a storage unit
- The booking form either doesn't load or shows "Unit Not Found"
- Form submission fails

**Why:**
The `BookingForm.js` component needs to:
1. Fetch unit details: `GET /api/units/${unitId}`
2. Submit booking: `POST /api/bookings`
3. Create payment record: `POST /api/payments`

All these API calls require the backend server to be running. Without it:
- Unit details cannot be fetched → form shows "Unit Not Found"
- Booking cannot be created → submission fails
- Payment record cannot be created → payment flow breaks

---

### Issue 3: Cannot Access Payments Page

**What's Happening:**
- After attempting to book, you're redirected to `/payment/{bookingId}`
- The page shows "Booking Not Found" or fails to load
- Payment options don't appear

**Why:**
The `Payment.js` component fetches booking details:
```javascript
const response = await fetch(`http://localhost:5001/api/bookings/${bookingId}`);
```

Without the backend server:
- Booking data cannot be retrieved
- Payment page cannot display booking summary
- Payment processing cannot proceed

---

## The Solution

### Primary Fix: Start the Backend Server

**Option 1: Use the startup script (Recommended)**
```bash
cd /Users/jeshurun/Documents/Smart-Storage-Management-System
./START_SERVERS.sh
```

**Option 2: Manual start**
```bash
cd /Users/jeshurun/Documents/Smart-Storage-Management-System/server
python3 app.py
```

You should see output like:
```
Database initialized successfully
Starting server on http://localhost:5001
 * Running on http://0.0.0.0:5001
```

### Verification Steps

After starting the server, verify it's working:

1. **Test API directly:**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:5001/api/units
   ```
   Should return JSON array of storage units

2. **Check in browser:**
   - Open http://localhost:5001
   - Should see: `{"message": "Smart Storage Management System API", "status": "running"}`

3. **Test the frontend:**
   - Navigate to http://localhost:3000/storage
   - You should now see your actual storage units (not static data)
   - Unit details should match what you created in admin dashboard

---

## Why This Happened

The application has two separate servers:
1. **Frontend (React)** - Runs on port 3000, handles UI
2. **Backend (Flask)** - Runs on port 5001, handles data and API

The frontend was running, but the backend was not. This created a situation where:
- The UI was visible and interactive
- But all data operations failed silently
- The app fell back to static/dummy data where possible

---

## Preventing This in the Future

### 1. Always Start Both Servers

Use the startup script to ensure both servers start:
```bash
./START_SERVERS.sh
```

### 2. Check Server Status

Before using the app, verify both servers are running:
```bash
# Check backend
lsof -i :5001

# Check frontend
lsof -i :3000
```

### 3. Monitor Logs

Keep an eye on server logs for errors:
```bash
# Backend logs
tail -f server/backend.log

# Or watch the terminal where you started the server
```

### 4. Use Browser DevTools

Open browser console (F12) to see network errors:
- Failed fetch requests indicate backend is down
- CORS errors indicate backend is running but misconfigured
- 404 errors indicate wrong API endpoints

---

## Complete Workflow

Here's the correct workflow to use your application:

### 1. Start Servers
```bash
./START_SERVERS.sh
```

### 2. Verify Backend is Running
```bash
curl http://localhost:5001/api/units
```

### 3. Access Admin Dashboard
- Go to http://localhost:3000/admin/login
- Login with: admin / admin123
- Create storage units

### 4. View Storage Units
- Go to http://localhost:3000/storage
- You should see the units you created
- Units should show real data (not static fallback)

### 5. Book a Unit
- Click "BOOK AND PAY NOW"
- Fill in the booking form
- Submit the form
- You should see success popup

### 6. Complete Payment
- You'll be redirected to payment page
- Booking details should be displayed
- Choose payment method and complete payment

## Technical Details

### Data Flow

1. **Admin creates unit:**
   ```
   Admin Dashboard → POST /api/units → Database (storageunit table)
   ```

2. **Customer views units:**
   ```
   Storage Page → GET /api/units → Database → Display units
   ```

3. **Customer books unit:**
   ```
   Booking Form → POST /api/bookings → Database (booking table)
                → POST /api/payments → Database (payment table)
   ```

4. **Customer pays:**
   ```
   Payment Page → GET /api/bookings/{id} → Display booking
                → POST /api/mpesa/stkpush → M-Pesa API
                → Callback → Update payment status
   ```

### Database Structure

Your database (`server/instance/storage.db`) contains:
- **storageunit**: Storage units created by admin
- **booking**: Customer bookings
- **payment**: Payment records
- **admin**: Admin users
- **user**: Customer users (optional)
- **feature**: Unit features
- **transportationrequest**: Transportation requests

All data is stored correctly in the database. The issue was purely about the backend server not running to serve this data to the frontend.

## Files Created to Help You

I've created several helper files:

1. **START_SERVERS.sh** - Starts both frontend and backend servers
2. **STOP_SERVERS.sh** - Stops both servers cleanly

## Next Steps

1. **Start the servers:**
   ```bash
   ./START_SERVERS.sh
   ```

2. **Test the storage page:**
   - Go to http://localhost:3000/storage
   - Verify you see your units

3. **Test booking:**
   - Click "BOOK AND PAY NOW"
   - Complete the booking form
   - Verify you reach the payment page

4. **Test payment:**
   - Complete a payment
   - Verify the booking status updates

If you encounter any issues after starting the servers, refer to `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` for detailed solutions.

## Summary

**Problem**: Backend server not running
**Solution**: Start the backend server with `./START_SERVERS.sh` or `cd server && python3 app.py`
**Result**: All three issues will be resolved

The application code is working correctly. You just need to ensure both servers are running before using the application.
