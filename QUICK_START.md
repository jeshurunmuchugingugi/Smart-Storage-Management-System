# Quick Start Guide - Smart Storage Management System

## üöÄ Getting Started in 3 Steps

### Step 1: Start the Servers

```bash
./START_SERVERS.sh
```

This will start:
- **Backend (Flask)** on http://localhost:5001
- **Frontend (React)** on http://localhost:3000

### Step 2: Access the Application

Open your browser and navigate to:
- **Main Website**: http://localhost:3000
- **Admin Dashboard**: http://localhost:3000/admin/login
- **Storage Units**: http://localhost:3000/storage

### Step 3: Login to Admin Dashboard

Default admin credentials:
- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: `admin123`

---

## üìã What You Can Do

### As Admin:
1. **Login** at `/admin/login`
2. **Create Storage Units** in the dashboard
3. **View Bookings** and manage reservations
4. **Track Payments** and transaction status

### As Customer:
1. **Browse Storage Units** at `/storage`
2. **Book a Unit** by clicking "BOOK AND PAY NOW"
3. **Complete Payment** via M-Pesa or Card
4. **Request Transportation** (optional) during booking

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Issue: Storage page shows no data after creating units in admin

**Solution**: Make sure the backend server is running!

```bash
# Check if backend is running
lsof -i :5001

# If not running, start it
cd server
python3 app.py
```

### Issue: Cannot book a storage unit

**Solution**: Backend server must be running on port 5001

```bash
./START_SERVERS.sh
```

### Issue: Cannot access payments page

**Solution**: Ensure you completed the booking successfully and backend is running

---

## üõë Stopping the Servers

```bash
./STOP_SERVERS.sh
```

Or manually:
```bash
# Stop backend
lsof -ti:5001 | xargs kill

# Stop frontend
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill
```
