# 🔐 RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) Implementation

## ✅ What Was Implemented

Role-Based Access Control system with three user roles: **Admin**, **Manager**, and **User**.

---

## 👥 User Roles & Permissions

### 1. **Admin** (Full Access)
- ✅ Create, Read, Update, Delete storage units
- ✅ View all bookings and payments
- ✅ Access admin dashboard
- ✅ Manage all resources

### 2. **Manager** (Limited Access)
- ✅ Create, Read, Update storage units
- ❌ Cannot delete storage units
- ✅ View all bookings and payments
- ✅ Access admin dashboard

### 3. **User** (Regular User)
- ✅ Create bookings
- ✅ View own bookings
- ✅ Make payments
- ❌ No admin dashboard access

---

## 🔧 Backend Implementation

### Role Decorator
Created `@role_required(['admin', 'manager'])` decorator in `app.py`:
- Checks JWT token
- Validates user role from database
- Returns 403 Forbidden if unauthorized

### Protected Endpoints

| Endpoint | Admin | Manager | User |
|----------|-------|---------|------|
| `POST /api/units` | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| `PUT /api/units/:id` | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| `DELETE /api/units/:id` | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `GET /api/bookings` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `POST /api/bookings` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

### JWT Token Enhancement
- JWT tokens now include `role` in additional claims
- Role is verified on every protected request

---

## 🎨 Frontend Implementation

### Role Storage
- User role stored in localStorage on login
- Role available via AuthContext: `admin.role`

### Conditional UI Rendering
- Delete buttons only visible to admins
- Edit buttons visible to admins and managers
- Dashboard access restricted by role

### Example Usage
```javascript
{admin?.role === 'admin' && (
  <button onClick={handleDelete}>Delete</button>
)}
```

## 🧪 Test Credentials

### Admin Account
- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: `admin123`
- **Permissions**: Full access

### Manager Account
- **Username**: `manager`
- **Password**: `manager123`
- **Permissions**: Cannot delete units

---

## 🚀 How to Test RBAC

### 1. Test Admin Role
```bash
# Login as admin
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/admin/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"admin","password":"admin123"}'

# Try to delete a unit (should succeed)
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:5001/api/units/1 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

### 2. Test Manager Role
```bash
# Login as manager
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/admin/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"manager","password":"manager123"}'

# Try to delete a unit (should fail with 403)
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:5001/api/units/1 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

### 3. Test in Browser
1. Login as **admin** → See delete buttons
2. Logout and login as **manager** → Delete buttons hidden
3. Try to delete via API → Get 403 error

## 📁 Modified Files

### Backend
1. `server/models.py` - Added `role` field to User model
2. `server/app.py` - Added role decorator and applied to endpoints
3. `server/seed.py` - Added manager test user

### Frontend
1. `client/src/components/Admin/UnitTab.js` - Conditional delete button
2. Role already stored in AuthContext (no changes needed)

## 🔒 Security Features

✅ **Backend Validation** - All role checks happen on server
✅ **JWT Claims** - Role included in token payload
✅ **Database Verification** - Role verified from database on each request
✅ **403 Forbidden** - Proper HTTP status for unauthorized access
✅ **Frontend Hiding** - UI elements hidden based on role

---

## 📊 RBAC Status

**Requirement**: ✅ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED**
